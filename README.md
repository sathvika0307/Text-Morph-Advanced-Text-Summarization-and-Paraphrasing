# 📝 AI-Text-Morph  
*A Text Readability, Summarization, and Paraphrasing Application*

---

## 📖 Description

**AI-Text-Morph** is a lightweight NLP-based application that allows users to **analyze, summarize, and paraphrase text** through an intuitive **Streamlit interface.**

Users can securely log in, then either **upload a file** or **paste text** directly into the platform. Once text is provided, the system offers multiple processing options:

- **Readability Analysis** – Evaluate text complexity using readability scores.

- **Summarization** – Generate concise summaries in **small, medium, or long lengths**.

- **Paraphrasing** – Rephrase text with **easy, medium, or advanced complexity**.

All processed outputs are securely stored in a **SQLite database** for consistency and future reference.

This project demonstrates the **practical integration of authentication, database storage, and rule-based NLP algorithms** within an interactive interface, making it both an educational and functional solution for text processing.
